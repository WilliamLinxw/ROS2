CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:41 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeigen_stl_containers.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "eigen_stl_containers", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "eigen_stl_containers" with any of the following names:

    eigen_stl_containersConfig.cmake
    eigen_stl_containers-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eigen_stl_containers" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "eigen_stl_containers_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "eigen_stl_containers" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
