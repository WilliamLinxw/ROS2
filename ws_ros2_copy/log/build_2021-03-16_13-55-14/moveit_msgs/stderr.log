CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findobject_recognition_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "object_recognition_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "object_recognition_msgs" with any of the following names:

    object_recognition_msgsConfig.cmake
    object_recognition_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "object_recognition_msgs" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "object_recognition_msgs_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "object_recognition_msgs" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
