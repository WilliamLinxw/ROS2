CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcontrol_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "control_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "control_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    control_msgsConfig.cmake
    control_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "control_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "control_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "control_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
